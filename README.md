Kasm AI for VST3 / AUv3 audio plugins

Kasm is artificial intelligence MIDI FX using WebAssembly (WASM) for WebXR

Ksm enables AR headsets and glasses like Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 to control your existing music DAWs like Apple Logic Pro, AVID Pro Tool and Ableton Live via MIDI

Kasm also triggers off of MIDI input, OSC and feedback from audio buses

Kasm _needs_ your existing gear for it to work, it doesn't generate noise itself!
